<!-- Guidelines and Rules -->
<section class="px-5 py-5 border-1 " id="features">
    Living in a gated community which is often synonymous with luxury living can be new and exciting experience. There is an air of exclusivity for those residing in this type of a community. One of the primary purposes of a gated community is to offer its
    residents safety that one would not experience in many non-gated communities. Just like any other type neighborhood, one must follow certain etiquettes to ensure that all residents can co-exist peacefully. Below is some such etiquette to follow in
    a gated community.

    <hr>
    <h2 class="h1 fw-bolder">Be a courteous neighbor</h2>
    <p class="px-5">When you meet your neighbor, try to greet them with a ‘smile’ or a ‘wave’. Most of the apartments organize events for special occasions, festivals and national holidays. This is a great way to meet your neighbors and talk to them. You can try to get
        to know them better by inviting them home for snacks or a meal and also be ready to help your neighbors in case they need it.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 class="h1 fw-bolder">Don’t be Noisy</h2>
    <p class="px-5">Every resident of a gated community looks for a peaceful environment to live in. If you are going to have a party at home, then remember to keep the noise levels low so that you don’t disturb your neighbors. Let your neighbors know in advance if any
        interior or exterior work is going to be happening at home and if there are any senior citizens in the neighborhood, make sure the work at home will end before evening which will ensure least disturbance.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 class="h1 fw-bolder">Maintain a clean Space</h2>
    <p class="px-5">Any gated community, while they ensure to employ cleaners in order to keep the surroundingsclean; it is also every resident’s responsibility to keep their surroundings clean. While using the wide array of common amenities and facilities like swimming
        pool, fully equipped gym, multipurpose hall, sidewalks etc., make sure you follow the rules and keep the spaces clean and free of debris.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 class="h1 fw-bolder">Follow traffic rules</h2>
    <p class="px-5">Any day, Safety is first. Speed limit is imposed in a gated community especially for the safety ofolder people and children around in the area.Residents are assigned designated parking area and visitors are allotted guests parking area. Be sure to
        stick to the parking areas to avoid causing any inconvenience to neighbors. Keep the honking minimum and avoid unnecessary honking inside the compound walls to avoid disturbing neighbors especially senior citizens.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 class="h1 fw-bolder">Solving Conflicts</h2>
    <p class="px-5">Since, most of the gated communities come with plush amenities and infrastructure; residents may encounter many issues with each other or with infrastructure. At such circumstances, make useof the complaint redressal system in order to sort any such
        issues. In case you encounter a direct issue with any neighbor, follow the common conflict resolution protocol and make sure to keep your tone polite and calm. Listen to what others have to say and try to come to an agreement that will be favorable
        to both parties involved. Be mindful of your actions and your words to be a valuable resident of a gated community.></p>
